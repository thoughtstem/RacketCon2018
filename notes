Title.  I pivoted my startup to use Racket.  Can we pivot the world?


****Intro****

I want to tell you a story.  

I'll tell you the whole story,
the  beginning the middle and the end.  But, when we get to the end, I
hope you'll keep in mind that the story isn't finished yet.  The 
beginning and middle are written.  They're in the past.  But the end,
that's where I'll lay out some hopes and dreams for the future.  


****Past*****

I was born.  That's true.  That's a fact.  I wish I could say that
I was introduced to Racket immediately upon arriving in this world.
But that would have been historically impossible back in 1985.  

I was, however, lucky enough to be introduced to programming
quite early because my mom was awesome.  We were living in the Middle
East, and at the time, women weren't allowed to drive, and honestly
it was kind of inconvenient for her to even leave our house because
she had to wear a veil -- which she wasn't a fan of.  So although
it was nine years of inconvenience for her, I was luck enough
that she was around (and bored enough) to teach me how to code
in BASIC on our Apple II.

I wish I could say I learned Racket back then, but that too would
have been historically impossible at the time.  From what I understand,
PLT Scheme was only just being created in the 90s.  

I'll get to Racket in just a moment, but there's one more important
point.  In high school, I had an unfortunate experience in a 
programming class that almost undid everything.  I won't go 
into the details, but essentially, it made me decide, categorically
that I didn't want to be a programmer.  I decided to give it up forever.
I enrolled in college as a psychology major, dropped out, tried
to be a sci-fi writter for a few years, living with my parents.
I eventually went back to college, when that didn't pan out.
And that's when something interesting happened.

Back in a tiny (but awesome) liberal arts school called Southwestern
University in Georgetown Texas, I took a programming class.
It was the first code I had written in about 6 or 7 years.  
Why did I take the class?  Well, I wish I could say it was for
good reasons, but really I was just taking it to fill a math
requirement for my philosophy degree.  If I'm being perfectly honest,
I figured it would be an easy A.  It turned out to be one of
the best decisions of my life.

In that class, though, we used this interesting thing called
DrScheme.  DrScheme.  You've probably never heard of it.  But
it was cool.  And it was that class that inspired me to 
take another computer science class, and another, and another,
until I ultimately finished up with a double-major in philosophy
and computer science.

Although that one class with DrScheme was the only class I
had with what-would-become-Racket.  The rest of my classes
used Haskell and Java.  Still, though, because of that first class
-- the one that pivoted me back into computing -- I have a
very soft spot for Racket.  And that class was the reason
the rest of this story turns out the way that it does.

I thought about calling this talk: How Racket Saved My Life.
But I thought that would be melodramatic.  True though it 
may be.


****Present****






I thought about calling this talk: How Racket Saved My Life,
and How It's Helping Me Save Others.
But I thought that would be melodramatic.  True though it 
may be.

****Future****






I thought about calling this talk: How Racket Saved My Life,
and How We the Racket Community Can Save the World.
But I thought that would be melodramatic.  True though it 
may be.
